In this site I am trying jekyll, a great framework built on top of ruby. I am using my macbook pro,subline text, iTerm2, git, and running a local server in Google Chrome. [www.renzosalvador.com](http://www.renzosalvador.com/)

You can find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at: [github.com/renzosalvador/jekyllsite](https://github.com/renzosalvador/jekyllsite)
